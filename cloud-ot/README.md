OT was designed to create collaborative Google Docs-like applications based on principles, which conceptually resemble 
Git but with support of arbitrary user-defined data types and automatic conflict resolution using operational 
transformations (OT). Unlike traditional databases, data is represented as commit graph. This approach revolutionizes 
and provides truly distributed and asynchronous online/offline data processing.


* Efficient algorithms for managing graph of commits.
* Ability to save/load snapshots and create backups.
* State manager allows to monitor current state of OT system.
