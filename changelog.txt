v 2.5.10

* Public API now use Duration and MemSize for corresponding values.

* ConfigConverters:
  - Add combinator for ConfigConverter. Now you can combine converters to get more specific converter.
  - Add new ConfigConverters for java.time classes

* Reworked boot module:
  - Simplification and customization of boot module launchers
  - Default launchers for RemoteFs, RPC and HTTP
  - Default Google Guice modules for providing basic components like Eventloop
  - Migrate configs to Java 8 convention
  - Config builders
  - Refactor Config

* Improved Stage API:
  - Replaced Stage.Hadlers with *ex methods for precise control over Stage execution
  - Introduced dedicated StageConsumer instead of standard BiConsumer

v2.5.9:

* Introduced simple, clean and optimized Stage's which replaced java CompletionStage's.
  Cleaned Stages api, now all common methods related directly to Stage is in Stage.
  Stages now used as a controller element for Stage's(with methods like all, any, reduce, etc...).

* Cleaned up and organised streaming completion stages.

* Introduced ReduceListener and ReduceCanceller to track and break ongoing reduce operations.

* ByteBuf's now can be serialized.

* StreamFileReader and StreamFileWriter got a bit simpler and easier to use.

* Many improvements on GC overhead and speed.

* Minor cleaning and refactoring.

v2.5.8:

* Now current eventloop is stored in a thread-local variable which greatly reduces code complexity
  when dealing with runtime components such as streams or stages.
  In top-level Guice components such as servers, clients and services eventloop works as before.

* Established clean and consisent policy with thread-local eventloops, now developer is forced to bind it to current
  thread explicitly instead of it being bound when created as before.

* DataStreams internal organization got simpler and cleaner.
  Now they use asynchronous notifications about their state instead of hardcoded methods.
  Stream binding got more functional as it consistently returns asynchronous streaming results when possible.

* Added StreamStats and StageStats - universal component for monitoring DataStreams statistics,
  stage timings and exceptions respectively.
  It allows to monitor and show any of the asynchronous stages or streams in JMX.
  Also it greatly simplifies creation of servlets with JMX monitoring.

* ExceptionStats got simpler and now always stores stacktraces.

* Release candidate of OT Cube with additional JMX metrics.

* Completely removed Guava and Joda Time libraries in favor of their Java 8 analogues.

* Added functional methods for AsyncFunction, AsyncPredicate, AsyncCallable etc. like ones added in Java 8.

* Replaced usages of Gson class with custom type adapters being created with new explicit builder-like structure.

* Created datakernel-common project for various generic utils (such as Preconditions) which are moved into it.
  Every module depends on it and it has no dependencies except optional gson (for those type adapter builders).

* Code Style: removed final from local variables everywhere.
