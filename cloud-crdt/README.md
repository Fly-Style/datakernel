CRDT module was designed to create collaborative editing applications with CRDT (conflicat-free replicated data type) 
approach. Well suitable for simple solutions (for example, a scalable eventually consistent key-value storage 
with CRDT conflict resolutions).

1. [CRDT example](https://github.com/softindex/datakernel/blob/master/examples/crdt/src/main/java/io/datakernel/examples/CrdtExample.java) - 
an example of conflict-free merging of two modified replicas.
