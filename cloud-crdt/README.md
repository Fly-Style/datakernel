## CRDT

CRDT module was designed to create collaborative editing applications with CRDT (conflicat-free replicated data type) 
approach. Well suitable for simple solutions (for example, a scalable eventually consistent key-value storage 
with CRDT conflict resolutions).

This module includes implementations of CRDT Client and Server along with useful built-in primitives needed for convenient 
CRDT applications development.
