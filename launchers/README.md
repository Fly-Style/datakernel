## Launchers

This module provides you with launchers for commonly-used solutions:
* HTTP server launcher
* RPC server launcher
* CRDT node launcher
* FS launchers

If you want to create your own application, you should either extend one of proposed launchers or use it as a reference 
for your custom launcher.

#### You can explore Launchers examples [here](https://github.com/softindex/datakernel/tree/master/examples/launchers).
