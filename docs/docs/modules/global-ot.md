Global-OT is a module which extends both [Cluster-OT](ot.html) technology and blockchain technology (representing the data as Git-like graph of individual immutable content-addressable commits, encrypted and signed with private key of its owner). It is suitable for solutions on the scale of the Internet and not bound to proprietary data centers. Global-OT can work with non-trusted servers, which is provided by implementation of digital signatures and encryption.
