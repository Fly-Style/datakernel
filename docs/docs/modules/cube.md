Cube OLAP (online analytical processing) is an LSM-tree (log-structured merge-tree) database designed for processing massive partial aggregations of raw data. It utilizes [Cluster-OT](ot.html) and [Cluster-FS](fs.html) technologies. 
Cluster-OLAP is truly asynchronous and distributed, with full support of transaction semantics.
