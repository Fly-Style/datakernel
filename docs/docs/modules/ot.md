OT was designed to create collaborative Google Docs-like applications based on principles, which conceptually resemble Git but with support of arbitrary user-defined data types and automatic conflict resolution using operational transformations (OT). Unlike traditional databases, data is represented as commit graph. This approach revolutionizes and provides truly distributed and asynchronous online/offline data processing.
